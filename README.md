# Employee Directory 

### User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

### Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Getting Started 


### Prerequisites

Create React App is a comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a new single page application in React. 

To create a project, run:

```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```
